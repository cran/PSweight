\title{Retrospective Factual Sample Dataset for PSweight Analysis}
\format{
A data frame with the subset of rows from \code{psdata_bin_retrospective_sp} (e.g. 600 rows)
and the same 10 variables as \code{psdata_bin_retrospective_sp}.
}
\usage{
data(psdata_bin_retrospective_fp)
}
\description{
A simulated dataset representing the observed (factual) sample drawn from the retrospective
superpopulation. This dataset is obtained by selecting only those observations with
\code{sample_indicator == 1}, where the sampling probability is a function of both covariates and treatment.
}
\details{
This dataset is derived from \code{psdata_bin_retrospective_sp} by retaining only
observations that were selected (i.e. those with \code{sample_indicator == 1}). It represents
the observed sample used for analysis under a retrospective design.
