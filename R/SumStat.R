#' Calculate summary statistics for propensity score weighting
#'
#' \code{SumStat} is used to generate distributional plots of the estimated propensity scores and balance
#' diagnostics after propensity score weighting.
#'
#' @param ps.formula an object of class \code{\link{formula}} (or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the propensity score model to be fitted. Additional details of model specification are given under ‘Details’. This argument is optional if \code{ps.estimate} is not \code{NULL}.
#' @param ps.estimate an optional matrix or data frame containing estimated (generalized) propensity scores for each observation. Typically, this is an N by J matrix, where N is the number of observations and J is the total number of treatment levels. Preferably, the column names of this matrix should match the names of treatment level, if column names are missing or there is a mismatch, the column names would be assigned according to the alphabatic order of treatment levels. A vector of propensity score estimates is also allowed in \code{ps.estimate}, in which case a binary treatment is implied and the input is regarded as the propensity to receive the last category of treatment by alphabatic order, unless otherwise stated by \code{trtgrp}.
#' @param trtgrp an optional character defining the "treated" population for estimating the average treatment effect among the treated (ATT). Only necessary if \code{weight = "ATT"}. This option can also be used to specify the treatment (in a two-treatment setting) when a vector argument is supplied for \code{ps.estimate}. Default value is the last group in the alphebatic order.
#' @param Z an optional vector specifying the values of treatment, only necessary when the covariate matrix \code{covM} is provided instead of \code{data}.
#' @param covM an optional covariate matrix or data frame including covariates, their interactions and higher-order terms. When the covariate matrix \code{covM} is provided, the balance statistics are generated according to each column of this matrix.
#' @param zname an optional character specifying the name of the treatment variable in \code{data}.
#' @param xname an optional vector of characters including the names of covariates in \code{data}.
#' @param data an optional data frame containing the variables in the propensity score model. If not found in data, the variables are taken from \code{environment(formula)}.
#' @param weight a character or vector of characters including the types of weights to be used. \code{"ATE"} specifies the inverse probability weights for estimating the average treatment effect among the combined population. \code{"ATT"} specifies the weights for estimating the average treatment effect among the treated. \code{"ATO"} specifies the (generalized) overlap weights for estimating the average treatment effect among the overlap population, or population at clinical equipoise. Default is \code{"ATO"}.
#' @param delta trimming threshold for estimated (generalized) propensity scores. Should be no larger than 1 / number of treatment groups. Default is 0, corresponding to no trimming.
#'
#' @details A typical form for \code{ps.formula} is \code{treatment ~ terms} where \code{treatment} is the treatment
#' variable (identical to the variable name used to specify \code{zname}) and \code{terms} is a series of terms
#' which specifies a linear predictor for \code{treatment}. \code{ps.formula} specifies logistic or multinomial logistic
#' models for estimating the propensity scores, when \code{ps.estimate} is \code{NULL}.
#'
#' When comparing two treatments, \code{ps.estimate} can either be a vector or a two-column matrix of estimated
#' propensity scores. If a vector is supplied, it is assumed to be the propensity scores to receive the treatment, and
#' the treatment group corresponds to the last group in the alphebatic order, unless otherwise specified by \code{trtgrp}.
#' When comparing multiple (J>=3) treatments, \code{ps.estimate} needs to be specified as an N by J matrix,
#' where N indicates the number of observations, and J indicates the total number of treatments.
#' This matrix specifies the estimated generalized propensity scores to receive each of the J treatments.
#' In general, \code{ps.estimate} should have column names that indicate the level of the treatment variable,
#' which should match the levels given in \code{Z}.
#' If column names are empty or there is a mismatch, the column names will be created following
#' the alphebatic order of treatmentlevels. The rightmost coulmn of \code{ps.estimate} is then assumed
#' to be the treatment group when estimating ATT. \code{trtgrp} can also be used to specify the treatment
#' group for estimating ATT.
#'
#' The argument \code{zname} is required when \code{ps.estimate} is not \code{NULL}.
#'
#' To generate balance statistics, one can directly specify \code{Z} and \code{covM} to indicate the treatment levels and
#' covariate matrix. Alternatively, one can supply \code{data}, \code{zname}, and \code{xname} to indicate the
#' same information. When both are specified, the function will prioritize inputs from \code{Z} and \code{covM}.
#'
#' Current version of \code{PSweight} allows for three types of propensity score weights used to estimate ATE, ATT and
#' ATO. These weights are members of a larger class of balancing weights defined in Li, Morgan, and Zaslavsky (2018).
#' When there is a practical violation of the positivity assumption, \code{delta} defines the symmetric
#' propensity score trimming rule following Crump et al. (2009). With multiple treatments, \code{delta} defines the
#' multinomial trimming rule introduced in Yoshida et al. (2019). The overlap weights can also be considered as
#' a data-driven continuous trimming strategy without specifying trimming rules, see Li, Thomas and Li (2019).
#' Additional details on balancing weights and generalized overlap weights for multiple treatment groups are provided in
#' Li and Li (2019).
#'
#' @return SumStat returns a \code{SumStat} object including a list of the following value:
#' treatment group, propensity scores, propensity score weights, effective sample sizes,
#' and balance statistics. A summary of \code{SumStat} can be obtained with \code{\link{summary.SumStat}}.
